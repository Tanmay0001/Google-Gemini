# Google Gemini API Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate and interact with the **Google Gemini API** using Google Colab for generating content based on both text and image prompts. The project showcases the use of Google's generative models for various AI-based tasks, such as text generation and image-based content generation.

## Overview

The **Google Gemini API** provides a powerful suite of generative models capable of performing content generation across multiple modalities. In this project, the following functionalities are demonstrated:

1. **Text-based Content Generation**: Using the Gemini API to generate insightful content based on text-based prompts.
2. **Image-based Content Generation**: Using an image to generate descriptive text content (e.g., a blog or social media caption).

## Key Features

- Integration with the **Gemini API** for text generation using a variety of models (e.g., `gemini-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`).
- Demonstration of how to handle image input and generate content based on that input.
- Clean and modular code for easy understanding and adaptability for other projects.

## Requirements

- Google Colab (for executing the notebook).
- **Google Gemini API** access (API key required).
- Python 3.x with necessary libraries installed (`google-generativeai`, `PIL`, `IPython`, etc.).

## Setup

1. **Install the necessary libraries**:
   You can install the required libraries in your Google Colab environment using:
   
   ```python
   !pip install google-generativeai
   !pip install pillow


API Key Setup:
import os
os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'] = 'your-api-key-here'
